# Milton Bolonha

Hi, I'm Milton Bolonha and I've been developing websites since 1998.

As a specialist, I curate and implement sustainable code. I have unique knowledge of the technology market. I work as a technology manager with proficiency in document management and optimizing advertising reach. I direct investments and make strategic decisions in marketing, advertising, and branding.

I have extensive experience in the Brazilian and global technology market. I am an Artificial Intelligence engineer, an open-source project manager, and I teach programming.

## Professional Summary

This book is an initiative of mine, technology mentor Milton Bolonha.

I have been a programmer and designer since 1998, a philanthropist since 2007, an Amazon best-selling author since 2018, and a "Top Rated" software engineer on UpWork since 2018.

I started learning to program at the age of 11 in the late '90s. I have always been self-taught and had to develop my own methods for understanding web programming.

Since then, I have developed literally thousands of websites, applications, and systems. My boldest career move was trying life in the capital city of São Paulo for the first time, leaving a town with a population of 20,000. And it worked!

From São Paulo to many other places. I also went through global financial crises, constant and devastating political crises in this field, and a pandemic.

I am a volunteer teacher in philanthropic services and have always loved making a difference in the lives of the people around me.

Over these years, with an extensive career in web development, I had opportunities both in Brazil and abroad, being nationally recognized as a programmer in the United States, Italy, and France.

Based in San Francisco, CA, USA, I am part of the GitHub Developer Program, which means I will provide you with all the GitHub support you need.

Through the 100 Open Startup program, I was hired by the healthcare giant HapVida for online technology consulting.

My startup Edu4Dev was evaluated by ACBOOST 22 of the São Paulo Commercial Association. Edu4Dev stood out with above-average product and governance in the program.

I worked for over 2 years at the American web agency Green Hat Web Solution. Green Hat is an agency specializing in WordPress.

Descola is an innovative startup in the field of courses, and its main partner is Cubo Itaú. They use technology created by me on their blog, with the same standards used in this book.

I have a long career in volunteer services, starting this passion in Paraíba between 2007 and 2009 with philanthropic (non-paid) work in various cities in the state.
